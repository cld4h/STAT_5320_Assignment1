	\section{Introduction}

This report is an analysis on residuals of Simple Linear Regression based on Anscombe's Quartet dataset. The parameters of the linear model is calculated from maximum likelihood first, the residuals of each dataset is then analyzed.
	%Sentence 1 and/or 2 should very broadly describe a problem that anyone can understand. Sentence 2 or 3 should narrow down the scope of the previous sentence to something that any of the other data science students can understand. By sentence 3 or 4, you should be introducing the problem that you are going to be discussing.
	
	
	\section{Data Description}
	
Anscombe's Quartet is a dataset constructed in 1937 by the statistician Francis Anscombe \citep{Anscombe1973}. It serves as a compelling illustration of the critical role that data visualization plays in analysis. This dataset emphasizes the impact of outliers and influential observations on statistical characteristics, underscoring the limitations of relying solely on summary statistics without considering the underlying data distribution.
	
	\section{Simple Linear Regression}

%Let $S_{xx} = \sum\left( x_{i} - \overline{x} \right) ^2$, and let $\tilde{\mu_i} = \tilde{b_{0}} + \tilde{b_1}x_i$ be the estimator for the fitted value for the linear model $\mathbf{y = X b}$.
%
%We have $V\left( \tilde{\mu_i} \right)  = \sigma^2 \left( \frac{1}{n}+\frac{\left( x_i - \overline{x} \right) ^2}{S_{xx}} \right) $

	We use linear model 
	$\hat{\mathbf{y}} = \mathbf{X}\hat{\mathbf{b}}$  
	to fit the four groups of data, where 
	$\hat{\mathbf{b}} = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y}$,
	and $\mathbf{X} = [\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{x}]$, $\mathbf{x}$ is the regressor of each group of data. 
	Rewriting $\hat{\mathbf{b}}$ in scalar form: 
	$\hat{\mathbf{b}} = \left( b_0,b_1 \right)^T $,
	where $b_1 = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \frac{\text{Cov}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}{\text{V}(\mathbf{x})}$ 
	and $b_0 = \overline{y} - b_1 \overline{x}$. 
	The coefficient of determination $R^2 =1-\frac{\text{SSR}}{\text{SST}} = 1 - \frac{\rVert \mathbf{y} - \hat{\mathbf{y}}\rVert^2}{\rVert \mathbf{y} - \overline{y}\cdot\mathbf{1}\rVert^2} $
